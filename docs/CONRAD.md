## Video: 3-5 minutes
Must show a model of the innovation (sketch, wireframe, prototype). We have a
working prototype: the Streamlit app (`app/streamlit_app.py`) and forecast maps
(`serein map`). Upload to YouTube/Vimeo (unlisted is OK) AND as MP4 < 800 MB.

## Website
Team story, mission; model of the innovation with images; brand (name, logo,
colors); accessible by direct link (may be hidden from search engines).

## How judges score (Scoring Guide)
| Weight | Area | What they ask | Our strongest evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 30% | Innovation | Unique? Impactful? Defensible? | Graph network on sensors + personal Bayesian plans; nothing like it in AirNow/PurpleAir/IQAir |
| 20% | Storytelling & Professionalism | Would an investor want more? | One child's story (Maya) + the backtest chart |
| 20% | Practicality | Will it work? Proof of concept? Evidence? | **Pre-registered backtest beating NOAA/EPA**, working app, tests |
| 20% | Marketing Strategy | Markets, buyers, competition | School districts, Medicaid asthma programs, air districts |
| 10% | Finances | Costs, revenue, funding | Cloud cost per city per month; free for families |

Practicality explicitly rewards "data, expert testimony, ... research establishing
feasibility": the backtest and an expert review (C-8) map directly onto it.
